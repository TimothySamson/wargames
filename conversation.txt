2:53:46 PMb0bbso you know that shell you found 
2:54:07 PMb0bbdo ls -l followed by the path to the shell and tell me what you see 
2:55:00 PMWebVisitor65309ls -l /usr/bin/showtext 
2:55:26 PMWebVisitor65309-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 53 Oct 16 14:00 /usr/bin/showtext 
2:55:32 PMb0bbok perfect 
2:55:54 PMb0bbso we see it is small, way too small to be binary and its readable by anyone on that system 
2:55:56 PMWebVisitor65309yeah. I've tried doing ssh  with the -t option to bandit26 
2:56:05 PMb0bbso you can do file  /usr/bin/showtext 
2:56:14 PMb0bbbut its obviously a shellscript 
2:56:16 PMb0bbso read it 
2:56:19 PMb0bbcat  /usr/bin/showtext 
2:56:24 PMb0bbits not an ssh trick 
2:56:55 PMWebVisitor65309yeah ive done that too, it reads the text.txt of the current home directory 
2:57:05 PMb0bbright 
2:57:06 PMWebVisitor65309and export term 
2:57:12 PMb0bbabsolutely 
2:57:21 PMb0bbnow I want you to be patient with me here 
2:57:42 PMb0bbI want you to understand this feeling right now, when you have no idea so you quickly skip and iterate blindly to get a result 
2:57:45 PMb0bbthis is not hacking 
2:57:49 PMb0bbBUT 
2:58:09 PMb0bbslowing down and taking time to understand things and then think about how to subvert them, and looking for ways to subvert them 
2:58:17 PMb0bbthat is hacking, that is what you must do here 
2:58:31 PMb0bbnow that sounds abstract, I understand, but that is applicable to lots of harder tasks 
2:58:36 PMb0bblets make it practical for you now 
2:58:44 PMb0bbso you know its not some ssh voodoo 
2:58:50 PMWebVisitor65309okay. Thanks for doing this btw :) yeah 
2:59:02 PMWebVisitor65309i spend like a couple of hours going through different ssh options lol 
2:59:39 PMb0bbyeah, and that is good, but its avoiding the nugget of our problem 
2:59:43 PMb0bband I usually start there 
2:59:50 PMb0bb(but when I get lazy I do the same, believe me) 
2:59:52 PMb0bbanyways 
2:59:55 PMb0bbso we have a shellscript 
3:00:05 PMb0bband it does the things you mentioned 
3:00:25 PMb0bbso what are our target programs in the shellscript 
3:00:51 PMb0bbif each command is a program, and each program we can influence with input is a target, list the targets 
3:01:43 PMWebVisitor65309there's the text.txt option but im pretty sure it's useless, cuz when i tried sshing to bandit26 i think it only prints ascii art 
3:01:50 PMWebVisitor65309i mean text.txt file. 
3:01:59 PMWebVisitor65309The commands are export and more. 
3:02:08 PMb0bbok perfect, lets start there 
3:02:30 PMb0bbnow it is kinda like what you did before 
3:02:39 PMb0bbwe iterate and look for areas we can influence 
3:02:42 PMb0bbbut less blindly 
3:03:02 PMb0bbthe idea is you keep an open mind but use logic and deduction to reduce options as you go 
3:03:04 PMWebVisitor65309ooh and i notices it uses /bin/sh as the shell? 
3:03:17 PMWebVisitor65309#!/bin/sh 
3:03:17 PMWebVisitor65309 
3:03:17 PMWebVisitor65309export TERM=linux 
3:03:17 PMWebVisitor65309 
3:03:17 PMWebVisitor65309more ~/text.txt 
3:03:17 PMWebVisitor65309exit 0 
3:03:37 PMWebVisitor65309instead of bash. 
3:03:47 PMb0bbok yeah, well spotted 
3:03:59 PMb0bbso in some circumstance maybe you have a point 
3:04:12 PMb0bbbut on these debian systems /bin/bash and /bin/sh are symlinks to /bin/dash 
3:04:19 PMb0bbsometimes they behave differently 
3:04:27 PMb0bbbut yes, you are finally looking at the details 
3:04:43 PMb0bbso export, eh, its a builtin command 
3:04:49 PMb0bbso is exit 
3:04:54 PMWebVisitor65309but when i do ls -l /bin/bash it doesnt have an l thingy 
3:05:03 PMb0bboh really? 
3:05:05 PMWebVisitor65309that symlinks usually have 
3:05:07 PMWebVisitor65309yeah 
3:05:17 PMWebVisitor65309-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1099016 May 15  2017 /bin/bash 
3:05:25 PMb0bbmorla might have switched this box, I know he did with some others 
3:05:32 PMb0bbok, so its not a debian system anymore :) 
3:06:04 PMb0bbso you know during this discovery process, which you are in 
3:06:15 PMb0bbyou should note details like this /binsh thing 
3:06:22 PMb0bband later it may or may not be useful 
3:06:47 PMWebVisitor65309ok. 
3:07:01 PMb0bbok so exit is a builtin command 
3:07:09 PMb0bbmeaning it is actually inside the shell, not another program 
3:07:15 PMb0bbso is export 
3:07:31 PMb0bbso honestly... the only thing I see is more 
3:07:50 PMb0bbmake sense? 
3:08:11 PMWebVisitor65309what do you mean inside the shell? Like it's independent of the shell you are in? 
3:08:36 PMWebVisitor65309the export and exit commands? like regardless of your shell it is the same command? 
3:08:55 PMb0bbwell /bin/sh is the shell here, since that is in the shebang, and those commands exit and export are defined in the actual code of /bin/sh 
3:09:08 PMWebVisitor65309ohhh okay. 
3:09:27 PMWebVisitor65309so more is not defined in the code in /bin/sh, but is some outside thing 
3:09:30 PMb0bbtype help in a shell 
3:09:43 PMWebVisitor65309ok 
3:09:44 PMb0bball of those command are ones inside the shell code 
3:10:01 PMb0bb(you are probably in a bash shell, similar but not exactly the same as sh) 
3:10:19 PMb0bbso in the binary /bin/sh, it has code for lots of these things 
3:10:26 PMb0bbwhich is different from say /bin/cat 
3:10:31 PMb0bbwhich is an actual program 
3:10:51 PMWebVisitor65309ok that makes sense 
3:10:59 PMb0bbexit [n] 
3:11:00 PMb0bbexport [-fn] [name[=value] ...] or export -p 
3:11:07 PMb0bbI see those in that help output 
3:11:18 PMb0bbso the only actual program here is more 
3:11:28 PMb0bbso we have ruled out everything except one option 
3:11:38 PMWebVisitor65309which is more 
3:11:54 PMb0bbnow I will grant you this, it does not seem like a good option, but many times in these discovery processes we skip over things that do not look like good options 
3:11:58 PMWebVisitor65309so i have to look at the source code for more? 
3:12:08 PMb0bbwell not quite yet 
3:12:11 PMWebVisitor65309oh its a binary file 
3:12:12 PMb0bblets take it slow here 
3:12:41 PMb0bbso the cool part about me showing you a better methodology on how to think, is to really share the most valuable lesson any hacker can have 
3:12:50 PMb0bbalways do the least work to get the biggest payoff 
3:13:20 PMb0bbso source code, sure, in some scenarios, that is where we will get the least work for the highest payoff 
3:13:36 PMb0bbbut in this case, do we really know what more does, what it can do, how it behaves? 
3:13:45 PMWebVisitor65309no 
3:14:01 PMb0bbso maybe, lets start with 2 things. 1. lets experiment and 2. lets read about more 
3:14:07 PMb0bbthen after that, you are on your own :) 
3:14:18 PMb0bbso man more 
3:14:41 PMb0bbmore  is  a  filter for paging through text one screenful at a time. 
3:14:52 PMWebVisitor65309yeah it's essentially less 
3:14:56 PMb0bbright 
3:14:57 PMWebVisitor65309or cat 
3:15:04 PMb0bbwell no, more like less 
3:15:07 PMb0bband that sentence says why 
3:15:14 PMb0bbit says one screenful at a time 
3:15:27 PMb0bbso that implies... its gotta be aware of how big the screen is 
3:15:47 PMb0bbok then a bunch of options 
3:15:51 PMb0bbso I scroll 
3:16:06 PMb0bbanything popping out so far? 
3:16:30 PMWebVisitor65309um 
3:16:41 PMWebVisitor65309https://thepasteb.in/p/98hR00qDK5Kfk 
3:16:45 PMWebVisitor65309!command or :!command 
3:16:45 PMWebVisitor65309                        Execute command in a subshell. 
3:16:55 PMWebVisitor65309i saw this? this might be helpful 
3:17:00 PMb0bbcrazy right 
3:17:04 PMb0bbthat is helpful 
3:17:25 PMb0bbhey also 
3:17:29 PMb0bblook right under that 
3:18:12 PMWebVisitor65309-v start up an editor in the current line? 
3:18:23 PMb0bbyeah 
3:18:32 PMb0bbso who knew more did all this stuff 
3:18:44 PMb0bbso wait, man pages are using more I think 
3:18:52 PMb0bbso while in the man page lets try some of these 
3:19:11 PMWebVisitor65309yes 
3:19:26 PMb0bbso I hit v, it said it couldn't open the editor because its std input 
3:19:28 PMWebVisitor65309yeah i tried doing ! ls in man, it did do an ls 
3:19:31 PMb0bband then ! and I did id 
3:19:38 PMb0bbok 
3:19:47 PMb0bbso we're putting the pieces together 
3:19:57 PMWebVisitor65309but v doesnt work 
3:20:05 PMWebVisitor65309cannot edit standard input 
3:20:17 PMb0bbright, that makes sense, this is not a real file we are using more on 
3:20:28 PMb0bbso lets move to the next step now we have some toys to play with 
3:20:33 PMb0bbthe experimentation phase 
3:20:41 PMb0bbwe want to observe behaviour 
3:20:47 PMb0bbso lets start with making a text file 
3:20:58 PMb0bbmove to a writable directory 
3:21:28 PMWebVisitor65309ok 
3:21:31 PMb0bband lets do echo -e "this is line 1\nthis is line 2\nthis is line 3" > magicfile.txt 
3:21:42 PMb0bbso we write 3 lines to magicfile.txt 
3:22:01 PMWebVisitor65309yup 
3:22:05 PMb0bb$ cat magicfile.txt 
3:22:05 PMb0bbthis is line 1 
3:22:07 PMb0bbthis is line 2 
3:22:08 PMb0bbthis is line 3 
3:22:11 PMb0bbok, looks good 
3:22:19 PMWebVisitor65309so lets write more lines until it does the paging stuff? 
3:22:26 PMb0bbso now I am curious about the difference between more and cat 
3:22:35 PMb0bbyeah well that is what I wanna check here 
3:22:44 PMb0bbhow does it know how many lines our display has 
3:22:54 PMb0bbbecause we can just resize a window 
3:22:58 PMb0bbbut it knows somehow 
3:23:16 PMb0bb$ more magicfile.txt 
3:23:16 PMb0bbthis is line 1 
3:23:18 PMb0bbthis is line 2 
3:23:19 PMb0bbthis is line 3 
3:23:25 PMb0bbso maybe if I make my display tiny 
3:23:32 PMb0bbso it can only display 2 lines 
3:23:45 PMWebVisitor65309OOO 
3:23:48 PMb0bbbingo 
3:23:51 PMWebVisitor65309oohhh 
3:23:52 PMWebVisitor65309okay 
3:24:00 PMb0bbnow wait 
3:24:05 PMb0bbthat editor never worked in the man page 
3:24:09 PMb0bbdoes it work here? 
3:24:22 PMb0bbI press v 
3:24:24 PMWebVisitor65309HAHAHAHA 
3:24:26 PMb0bbboom, 
3:24:26 PMWebVisitor65309OH I GET IT 
3:24:31 PMb0bbright right 
3:24:32 PMWebVisitor65309so make the window tiny 
3:24:37 PMWebVisitor65309and ssh into bandit26 
3:24:40 PMb0bbyeah for sure 
3:24:44 PMWebVisitor65309and execute the command 
3:24:45 PMb0bband if you really want to know why 
3:24:49 PMWebVisitor65309Damn that clever 
3:24:54 PMb0bbthere are 2 env vars LINES and COLUMNS 
3:25:15 PMb0bb$ echo $LINES 
3:25:15 PMb0bb30 
3:25:28 PMb0bbthen I resize 
3:25:29 PMb0bb[00:24:38] <WebVisitor65309> and ssh into bandit26 
3:25:32 PMb0bberr 
3:25:46 PMWebVisitor65309thanks a lot man! I appreciate it. 
3:25:58 PMb0bbsure 
3:26:06 PMb0bbjust ask the right questions and slow down a bit 
3:26:08 PMb0bbplay around 
3:26:12 PMWebVisitor65309Damn you guys are really clever 
3:26:25 PMb0bbnow the next part is all up to you, and believe me, there is a bit more work to be done 
3:26:30 PMb0bbbut follow the same script we did before 
3:26:33 PMb0bbyou have all the parts 
3:26:36 PMb0bband enjoy it 
3:26:53 PMWebVisitor65309I am man. This hacking game is fun xD 
3:26:58 PMb0bb:)
